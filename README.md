Participants had the possibility to check some or all boxes provided with this question. Because some participants checked a lot of boxes 
and some non (NA) this data is in 'long format'.

In de variable 'Number' the number of the participant is stated. If a participant checked 6 boxes, there are thus 6 lines of this 
participant with each of his choices stated in the column 'Choice'an for easy reading 'Choice_short'.
